				My works consist of games spread across various platforms such as web 
games, executables, or tangible media such as cards which explore various themes of 
identity while also treading new paths in exploring compelling avenues of game 
design. My works vary greatly in their form and feel but retain my underlying pursuit 
of exploration and individuality. In all of my work lies a statement on the power of 
understanding, creativity, and idiosyncrasy. <br>
I seek to explore why games are designed the way they are, stylizing my 
exploration as an experience for the audience to undergo with me. I pursue works 
which captivate me in their craft, expressing such passion in layers of variation. My 
works vary from comedic to somber tones, while maintaining a level of creative 
subversion and depth, providing unique moments of responsivity that elevate the 
individualized experience.
